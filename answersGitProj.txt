Question #1 "What is Version Control"
Answer 
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Question #2 "What is the difference between distributed and centralized version control systems?
Answer
centralized version control systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place, whereas with distributed version control systems clients fully mirror the repository, notjust check out the latest snapshot of the files.

Question #3
What does a version control program do for us?
Answer
allows us to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back toa previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. It generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.
